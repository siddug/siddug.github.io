Whatever I write here comes first and in big slick style

This is the normal sized actual content

**for bold** *for italic* [link](forlinking)

## add as many hashes before a line to make it h1 to h6 styled. 

continuing <u>for underline</u>
<cite>for citing</cite>

### for block quotes
> use > to write stuff in block quote
<cite>cite again to end it well</cite>

use 

1.	1
2.	2mm
	1. 	2.1
	2. 	2.2
for ordered lists

and one star for unordered lists

* 1
* 2
* 3

### Ordered Lists

1. Item one
   1. sub item one
   2. sub item two
   3. sub item three
2. Item two

### Unordered Lists

* Item one
* Item two
* Item three

for tables follow the format for html. no change there!

to higlight code
use 
{% highlight c %}
int main(){
	float stuff;
return 0;
} 
{% endhighlight %}

Add buttons easily with normal anchor links like in html5. but use class = button.
<a class="button">check</a>

	give a tab at hte start and write to make it look red :P

put other images in site like this

	![any name]({{site.url}}/images/file.jpg) but obviosuly without a tab

use foundation grids. remember the small-2, large-3 columns?

Generate table of contents for a post like this

	<section id="table-of-contents" class="toc">
	  <header>
	    <h3 >Contents</h3>
	  </header>
	<div id="drawer" markdown="1">
	*  Auto generated table of contents
	{:toc}
	</div>
	</section>

use 
	{: .notice}
