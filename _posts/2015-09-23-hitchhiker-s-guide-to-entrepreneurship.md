Assuming building a startup is a 100+ step process, I believe that we dont need to start from step 0 ourselves anymore. I believe that it can and should be that we start from step 1 by learning from what others have already done to reach there.

## Prologue
I wanted to be an entrepreneur from my college times. And once you want to be one, you have lot of ideas that come and go. In the initial days, I used to start building the product straight away. Literally on the very day the idea striked me. In the process of building the product, I used to realize the mistakes I made, both in product design or idea evaluation and it comes to the stage where product stays in my laptop or my phone and drop pursuing it further. I always believed that if you have an idea, you start working on it. You learn when you fail. But I think before even starting the work on an idea - by getting co-founders in, design the product and the chaos that follows, there is something else. A step 0. 

## Step 0
Search. Investigate. Analyse. Search about your product idea, Investigating about it and analyzing it in every single direction. It's not like I never did it for my previous ideas. I did it little late. And by the time you have the product, you are too attached to it. (trust me, when you wrote the entire code yourself, you get attached atleast a little bit :P). 

# Resources
I am listing some of the resources that I found interesting as I learnt some basics of how this step 0 works. Even though a lot of it is what I already knew (and has a lot of videos that I ran on 2x), it was worth going through them. 

- Online lectures 
	1. [Edx Entrepreneurship 101](https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-101-who-customer-mitx-15-390-1x-0) - This 101 course by Bill Aulet introduces terminology with which you talk about the idea and some pretty basic concepts. (Fun fact for tech guys: If you register for approved certificate and pass the course, AWS gives 1000$ worth of webservices free for one year :D Not sure if they are still doing it though). 
    2. [Edx Entrepreneurship 102](https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-102-what-can-you-do-mitx-15-390-2x-0) - I recently started on their 102 and some of the talks with current entrepreneurs are great.
- Podcasts
	1. [How to Start A Startup](https://itunes.apple.com/in/podcast/how-to-start-a-startup/id922398209?mt=2) - This podcast has some great talks from YCombinator community. I had to skip some coz they didn't fit what I was looking for, but some videos were awesome.
    2. Though I have listened to some podcasts for Entrepreneurs, it was 1-2 episodes and not an entire season. I am planning to follow more in coming days and will update this space.
- Random listings: the below ones are completely random links. They dont completely fit in Step 0. But listing here in case someone might find them useful. 
	1. [Don't make me think](http://www.amazon.in/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758) - A friend suggested me this book and one of the major reasons I picked it up is that it is amazingly small. I finished the whole book in 2-3 hours. Though it is mostly about the design considerations one should keep in mind while designing websites, lot of principles apply for mobile applications too. I would suggest anyone who got to do anything with desiging interfaces to give it a try.
    2. [Startup Stash](http://startupstash.com/) - This is a collection of links to resources that you might use at different stages of startup. Though the list is not complete, they are a start :)
