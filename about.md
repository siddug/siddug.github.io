**Image &#183; Design &#183; Develop** - Something I love to do (and get paid for!). Currently working [@Headout_App](https://twitter.com/Headout_App) on product. Developed [Headout's iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/headout/id899327000?mt=8) from scratch last December. Now working on revamping the mobile web app. Previously at Goldman and [@PaxPlay](https://twitter.com/PaxPlay). Current pet project - [EarlyDo](http://earlydo.com/).

Always up for a good conversation about anything product and startup. Feel free to ping me. Lets catch up over some coffee/beer.
