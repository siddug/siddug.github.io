My name is **Siddhartha Gunti**, and this is my personal blog.

I like programming and the challenges involved in designing algorithms. I keep myself engaged with a project, learning new languages/features/api. 

You can find details about what I have worked on recently at <a href="{{site.url}}/featured">Featured posts</a> section. Or browse through them categorically at <a href="{{site.url}}/categories"> Categories </a> section.

Apart from Coding, I like to read/write novels, cook, blog and randomly solve new probability and math puzzles. You can find some of them in this blog.
